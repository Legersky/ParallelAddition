Checking alphabet for representatives mod base:
Number of congruence classes mod base is: 4
Alphabet divided into congruence classes:
[[0], [1], [-1], [2, -2]]
=> There are all representatives mod base in the alphabet.
Checking alphabet for representatives mod base-1:
There are all elements of the input alphabet mod base-1 in the alphabet.
